& This can be used to 
control an autonomous humanoid robot. The Movement state of the robots are purely depends on either Process-directed(continous 
process) or target-directed strategy(exchanging target process).[2] \\

& \\
& II.System Construction \\
& The Authors successfully develop an EEG-based, hybrid BMI with a highly modular structure 
to account for the needs of brain-robot interfaces, in particular to allow for easily 
interfacing to different robots. They used Honda's Humanoid Research Robot. Their BMI system exploits two distinct cortical activity patterns to increase the number 
of controlled dimensions.Raw data stream are constantly scanned for both patterns.\\
& \\
& III.Experimentation and Result \\
& All experiment was conducted with the real, physical robot. The authors used realistic-
type task. They created a simplified "store" in lab which each "store" have 3 shelves, 
arranged at the three sides of a rectangular area. Ten basket in different colors are 
placed on these shelfs. The robot are saved with an image of how the positioning of the 
shelves. The BMI user need to collect five out of ten baskets by navigating the robot 
close to that item. The location are fixed equally to each of the subject. 
There are only four directions that can be used and navigated for the robot which is 
forward, backward and sidesteps left or right side.  There are seven participants involved in this 
experiment and they need to do six times of valid sessions to get six data sets.  Once a robot finish "step" or "turn", the 
system will request new state decision from the data processing module. The robot will 
only leave BMI zone if they are in the vicinity of basket and calling for the movement of 
"grasping". \\

& \\
& After everything is recorded, the author notice of slight EEG error in hybrid BMI, which 
is error detection rate of 0.23; because the EEG in BMI are not perfect. Some participants 
are having difficulty with performing ERD in the complex setting. This assumptions are 
made because of error-state detection rates which is 0.3; for the ERD part alone, but the 
P300 are not affected by this.  \\
& \\
& IV. Conclusion\\
& The Authors implement this advanced yet sophisticated system approach is to help 
handicapped people with robots as their intermediary. . Empirical study was used together with HHRR in the robotics lab where they employed and 
every-day task like shopping and related to test the functionality of the systems.\\

& Out of all participants, only one successfully used the switching of P300 and ERD 
naturally. \\
